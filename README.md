# Matrix-2x2
This is a functional 2x2 matrix data structure with built in functions.

This is a 2x2 Matrix Data structure that has functions to add, subtract, multiply, scalar multiply and inverse the matrix.

These matrices are done using a cpp data type known as a structure, the reason why I avoided using 2D arrays (besides the fact that my professor was against it)
is simply because I am able to dictate exactly the precise coordinates of the matrices and I am able to assign it to a specific member allowing me to manipulate
those members with relative ease.
